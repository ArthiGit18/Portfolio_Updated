          <p>
            I'm <strong>Arthi A</strong>, a passionate Frontend Web Developer with a flair for creating
            elegant and responsive user interfaces. I specialize in building seamless
            web experiences using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js</strong>, and modern UI libraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love transforming ideas into engaging digital products. With a growth mindset and
            a hunger to explore, I constantly refine my skills in technologies like <strong>MERN stack</strong>,
            UI/UX principles, and responsive design. I believe great code is not just functional but also clean and meaningful.
